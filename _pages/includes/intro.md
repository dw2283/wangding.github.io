I am currently working on knowledge platform development and agentic systems to advance intelligent system design. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [wangding@pjlab.org.cn](mailto: wangding@pjlab.org.cn) or [wangding.mellissa@gmail.com](mailto: wangding.mellissa@gmail.com) . <span style="color:red">We are hiring interns! </span> Please feel free to hit me up with your CV if interested.

I received my Ph.D. from New York University, where I focused on large-scale multi-agent simulations for mobility in smart cities. Prior to that, I obtained both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Transportation Engineering and Planning from Beijing Jiaotong University. 


My research focuses on the development of agentic AI systems and agent infrastructure, with applications in intelligent systems. I am specifically interested in advancing Knowledge Graphs (KG), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agent memory, and lifelong learning agents. I have published 30+ papers at top journals and international conferences.
