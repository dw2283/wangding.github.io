I am currently working on knowledge platform development and agentic systems to advance intelligent system design. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [wangding@pjlab.org.cn](mailto: wangding@pjlab.org.cn) or [wangding.mellissa@gmail.com](mailto: wangding.mellissa@gmail.com) . <span style="color:red">We are hiring interns! </span> Please feel free to hit me up with your CV if interested.

I received my Ph.D. from New York University, where I focused on large-scale multi-agent simulations for mobility in smart cities. Prior to that, I obtained both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Transportation Engineering and Planning from Beijing Jiaotong University. 

My research interests include the development of knowledge platforms and knowledge graphs (KG), artificial intelligence (AI), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and agentic systems, with a particular focus on designing intelligent systems. I have published 20+ papers at top journals and international conferences.
